## 🛡️ Cybersecurity & Data Leakage Protection

**Your data privacy is our priority.**  
This project is **100% secure and free from data leakage risks**. Here's why:

- 🔒 **No external API calls**: All processing is done locally. Your text never leaves your system.  
- 🧠 **No training required**: The model doesn't learn from your data. It uses pre-trained transformer embeddings.  
- ❌ **No data logging**: Nothing is stored or shared—perfect for handling sensitive or proprietary content.  
- 🏢 **Safe for business use**: Enterprise teams can confidently use this for private documents, campaign material, and confidential content.

This makes it ideal for businesses and developers working in **cybersecurity-sensitive environments** such as:

- Government portals  
- Healthcare & patient data  
- Confidential product launches  
- Financial and legal services

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes – The Algorithm

### 🔍 What is KeyBERT?

[KeyBERT](https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT) is a keyword extraction technique that uses BERT embeddings to find the most relevant words or phrases from a body of text. It compares candidate phrases to the entire text by computing **cosine similarity** between sentence embeddings, helping identify keywords that are **context-aware** and **human-like**.

We use the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from the [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) library, which balances performance and speed, especially in production environments.
