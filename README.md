## 🧠 Behind the Scenes – The Algorithm

### 🔍 What is KeyBERT?

[KeyBERT](https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT) is a keyword extraction technique that uses BERT embeddings to find the most relevant words or phrases from a body of text. It compares candidate phrases to the entire text by computing **cosine similarity** between sentence embeddings, helping identify keywords that are **context-aware** and **human-like**.

We use the **`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`** model from the `sentence-transformers` library, which strikes a great balance between performance and speed, especially in production environments.
